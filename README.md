# ray-casting-3D-rendering-engine
NOTE: This is a work-in-progress-during-my-free-time project and it's far from complete, clean or optimized.


This is my ray casting engine coded from scratch in C++ mimicking the engine of Wolfenstein 3D by John Carmack originally released in 1991 by id Software.

It has custom distance based shader. Also some other features are coming like texture mapping etc.
For drawing I use SDL2 so it's highly portable.

Use XCode on Mac to build it or just whatever other compiler you like. The code is native and no extra libs are used whatsoever (except sdl2 but it should be working seamlessly with any compiler).

It's work in progress so this readme may become obsolete at some point.
