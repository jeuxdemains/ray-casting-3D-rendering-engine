# ray-casting-3D-rendering-engine
This is my ray casting engine coded from scratch in C++ mimicking the engine of Wolfenstein 3D by John Carmack.
It's clarified and simplified codewise than most of the exmaples on the net which makes it easy to understand and stable.

For drawing I use SDL2 so it's highly portable.
